# Node.js Learning Repository

This repository serves as documentation of my Node.js learning journey. Here, I'm recording the process and code snippets as I delve into the world of Node.js development.

## Getting Started

Before running the application, make sure to install the required npm packages. Open your terminal and run the following command in the **NODE-FIRST-APP** folder:

```bash 
npm install
```
## Running the app

To start the application, use the following command:

```bash
npm start
```
This will launch the Node.js application and make it accessible on the specified port (localhost:3000). Visit the URL below to view the application.

[localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)

Note: For assignments, execute the same `npm install` command in the respective assignment folder (e.g., **'/01 assignment'**) to install the required dependencies.
